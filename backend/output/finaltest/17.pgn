1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
exd5 cxd5 4. Nf3 { White plays the very natural Nf3; we will continue by
developing ur kingside to its best square. } 4... Nf6 5. Bd3 { Pin white's
knight! } 5... Bg4 $1 6. O-O { attack white's undefended d4 pawn and
develop at the same time. } 6... Nc6 { [%cal Rc6d4] } 7. c3 { Open up the
diagonal for your dark-squared bishop } 7... e6 { [%csl
Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5,Bb4,Ba3][%cal Gf8e7,Ge7d6] } 8. Bg5 { White decides to pin
your knight to your queen. Usually, when we see this, we want to unpin. How
do you unpin the most effective way? } 8... Be7 $1 9. Nbd2 { Get your king
to safety! } 9... O-O 10. Re1 { White played Re1, getting their rook into
the game and protecting the key e5 square. We will draw back our
light-squared bishop to h5. } 10... Bh5 $1 { With this clever defensive
idea going for trade on g6, we can nullify the pressure from the strong
Bd3. In the future, we would also like to start queenside play with Rb8 and
b5-b4 to create weaknesses and targets on White's queenside. This is known
as the minority attack; as said in the previous chapters, this is our main
middlegame plan! :D } { [%cal Rh5g6,Ra8b8,Rb7b5,Rb5b4] } *
