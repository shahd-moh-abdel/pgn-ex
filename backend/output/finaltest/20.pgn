1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
Nc3 { White plays the classical line of defending their central pawn. We
will proceed by capturing their central pawn anyway. } 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 {
This is because we can follow up with Nf6 and gain quick development } 4...
Nf6 5. Nxf6+ { which pawn do you take back with? } 5... exf6 { Correct!
Taking back with the e-pawn is best because it opens up the diagonal for
the dark-squared bishop to be developed. This opening is known as the
Tartakower Variation } { [%csl
Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5,Bb4,Ba3,Gc8,Gd7,Ge6,Gf5,Gg4,Gh3] } 6. Nf3 { What is the
most natural developing square for our dark-squared bishop? } { [%csl Bf8]
} 6... Bd6 $1 { Correct! In the Tartakower Variation, your dark-squared
bishop belongs on the d6 square, in most cases you develop your
dark-squared bishop before you pin white's knight with your light-squared
bishop. } 7. Bd3 { Get the king to safety } 7... O-O 8. O-O { Now you can
pin White's knight } { [%csl Bc8] } 8... Bg4 $1 9. h3 { White attacks our
light-squared bishop immediately. What move do we play here, do we draw
back or trade? } 9... Bxf3 { Trading is not very good in this case because
White gets free development. } *
