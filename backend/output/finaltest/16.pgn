1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
exd5 cxd5 4. c4 { White strikes in the center with c4. This opening is
known as the Panov Attack. Develop a piece and protect your d5 pawn. } 4...
Nf6 5. Nc3 { Prepare to fianchetto your dark-squared bishop on the a1 - h8
diagonal } 5... g6 $1 6. Qb3 { What were we preparing? } 6... Bg7 $1 { We
don't really care if White takes our d5 pawn because we will easily win it
back. } 7. cxd5 { As you can see, White's doubled d's are a liability and
can be easily targeted since they are super weak! For now, we will just
castle and get our king to safety. } { [%csl Bd5,Bd4][%cal Rd5d4,Rd4d5] }
7... O-O 8. Be2 { What is a developing knight move that prepares to add
pressure on white's d5 pawn? } 8... Nbd7 $1 { Correct! That might have been
tough to see for some of the beginners playing this, but the point is to
play Nb6 next and attack on the sides of the board. } { [%cal
Gb8d7,Gd7b6,Rb6d5,Rf6d5] } 9. Bf3 { What were we preparing? } 9... Nb6 $1 {
[%cal Rb6d5,Rd8d5,Rf6d5] } 10. Nge2 { White develops their knight out
because they are planning to play Nf4 next, adding more protection to their
d5 pawn. How do we get rid of White's light-squared bishop? I'll give you a
hint: Use your light-squared bishop. } { [%csl Bc8][%cal Gg1e2,Ge2f4] }
10... Bg4 $1 { Correct! White is forced to take, unless they want more
doubled pawns. } 11. Bxg4 Nxg4 12. a4 { White plays a4 with the idea of a5,
we will retreat our kingside knight back to where it can attack white's d5
pawn. } { [%cal Ra4a5] } 12... Nf6 $1 { [%cal
Rf6d5,Rb6d5,Rd8d5,Bc3d5,Bb3d5] } 13. Nf4 { Not wanting to lose their
precious central pawn, white protects with their knight. How do we stop
whites from advancing their a4 pawn to where it can attack our queen's
knight? } { [%cal Bf4d5,Bc3d5,Bb3d5,Rf6d5,Rd8d5,Rb6d5] } 13... a5 { [%csl
Ga5,Ga4] } 14. O-O { Develop your queen and prepare to double up on the
d-file. } 14... Qd6 $1 { [%cal Ga8d8,Gf8d8] } 15. Re1 { Offer a queen trade
} 15... Qb4 $1 16. Qd1 { Add more pressure on white's d5 pawn with one of
your rooks. } 16... Rad8 $1 { We don't want to use our f-rook to protect
because we want to keep the idea of Rfe8 open, protecting our central
pawns. } { [%csl Rd5,Rd4][%cal Bf8e8,Ye8e1,Yd8d1,Gd8d5,Gf6d5,Gb6d5] } *
