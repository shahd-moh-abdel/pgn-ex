1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
exd5 { The next few chapters will examine the take-variation, which occurs
if white takes our pawn. Since we played c6 to expand with d5, what should
we recapture with? } 3... cxd5 { Very good; it wouldn't make much sense to
capture with the queen if we played c6 to start. The position is starting
to resemble a queen's pawn structure. } 4. Bd3 { Develop your queenside
knight and attack white's undefended d4 pawn. } { [%csl Bb8] } 4... Nc6 5.
c3 { Develop your other knight } 5... Nf6 { Knights before bishops! } {
[%csl Bc6,Bf6] } 6. Bf4 { Since White is delaying the development of their
kingside knight, we have to develop and attack White's queen with tempo.
Play Bg4 anyway. } 6... Bg4 $1 { If white decides to push f3, this is a bad
move since it weakens their king's diagonal, and could invite some harmful
attacking ideas from us. } { [%csl Be1,Bf2,Bg3,Bh4][%cal Rf2f3] } 7. Qb3 {
Instead, White develops their queen out and takes advantage that b7 is no
longer guarded. Find the best way to defend b7. } { [%cal Rb3b7] } 7... Na5
{ This is one way to defend, but white can force a perpetual with Qa4+ Nc6
Qb3 Na5 Qa4+ Nc6 Qb3 Na5 Qa4+ } { [%cal Gb3a4,Ga5c6,Ga4b3,Gc6a5] } *
