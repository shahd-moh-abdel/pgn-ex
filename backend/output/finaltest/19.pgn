1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
Nc3 { White plays the classical line of defending their central pawn. We
will proceed by capturing their central pawn anyway. } 3... dxe4 4. Nxe4 {
This is because we can follow up with Nf6 and gain quick development } 4...
Nf6 5. Nxf6+ { which pawn do you take back with? } 5... gxf6 { Taking back
with the g-pawn might look tempting, as it opens up the g-file where you
can strategically place your h-rook on it, but it does not help us develop
pieces fast. } *
