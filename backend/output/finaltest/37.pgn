1. e4 c6 { [%cal Gd7d5] } 2. d4 { [%csl Ge4,Gd4] } 2... d5 { [%csl
Gd5,Gc6,Gb7] } 3. f3 { [%csl Gf3,Ge4,Gd4] } 3... e5 $3 { A violent
reaction! Our idea is to remove the d4 pawn so we can get access to
weakened g1-a7 diagonal. } { [%csl Re5] } 4. dxe5 { White accepts our
gambit 62% of the time. It makes sense to grab a free pawn in the center! }
{ [%cal Ra7g1] } 4... Bc5 $1 { Taking control of the weakened diagonal. }
5. Nc3 { White's best bet is to keep developing. This also creates ideas of
Na4. And you'll see this move the most (38%). } 5... Ne7 { Just continuing
with development and gunning for long term compensation with White's
stranded king. } 6. Bd3 { Trying to get on with development is best, and
it's played 13% of the time. } 6... O-O 7. Nge2 Ng6 { [%cal Rg6e5] } 8. f4
Nh4 { [%cal Rh4g2] } 9. Kf1 f6 *
