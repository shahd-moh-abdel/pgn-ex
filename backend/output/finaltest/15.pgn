11. Qxb7 { White takes our b7 pawn and now is in deep trouble. What move
attacks the queen and forces her to move away? } 11... Rb8 $1 12. Qa6 { Get
your king to safety! If you regain material too quickly, White can pin your
knight and white is guaranteed to win material! } { [%csl Rc6,Re8][%cal
Rd3b5,Gb8b2,Rb5e8] } 12... O-O $1 13. O-O { Attack the queen once more with
your rook! } 13... Rb6 $1 14. Qa3 { Trade queens } 14... Qxa3 15. bxa3 {
Develop your kingside rook to where it can exert pressure the semi-open
c-file } 15... Rc8 $1 { Even though we are down a pawn, White has a
terrible queenside structure. They have doubled and isolated a-pawns, and
their d and c-pawn islands are very weak. In most cases, you can target
these pawns and win material back, if not more material. } { [%csl
