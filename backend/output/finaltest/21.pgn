1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Qe2+ { White tries to
disrupt our natural development with Qe2+. However we can simply block it
with Be6. } 7... Be6 8. Be3 { Get your king to safety } 8... O-O 9. O-O-O {
According to the Lichess Database, O-O-O is played 61% of the time. White
is trying to be aggressive, and push pawns on the kingside. However, White
blundered a pawn. Can you find the winning move? } 9... Bxa2 $1 { Correct!
If White tries to go b3 to trap our light-squared bishop, we can follow up
with Ba3+, and White has to move their king back into the center. } 10. b3
{ What do we play here? } 10... Ba3+ $1 { [%csl Ra3,Rb2,Rc1,Ra2,Rb1][%cal
Ra3c1,Ra2b1] } 11. Kd2 { Now, we can follow up with another powerful check.
} { [%csl Bd8] } 11... Qa5+ $1 { [%csl
Re1,Rd2,Rc3,Rb4,Ra5,Ra3,Ra2,Rb2,Rb1,Rc1][%cal Ra3c1,Ra2b1,Ra5e1] } 12. Kd3
{ Develop your queenside knight to the best square where it can create
threats on the very weak White king. } { [%csl Bb8] } 12... Na6 $19 {
Correct! Our knight is now threatening to give a check on b4 to the White
King. White is completely losing. } { [%cal Ra6b4] } *
