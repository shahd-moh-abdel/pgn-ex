1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
exd5 { The next few chapters will examine the take-variation, which occurs
if white takes our pawn. Since we played c6 to expand with d5, what should
we recapture with? } 3... cxd5 { Very good; it wouldn't make much sense to
capture with the queen if we played c6 to start. The position is starting
to resemble a queen's pawn structure. } 4. Bd3 { Develop your queenside
knight and attack white's undefended d4 pawn. } { [%csl Bb8] } 4... Nc6 5.
c3 { Develop your other knight } 5... Nf6 { Knights before bishops! } {
[%csl Bc6,Bf6] } 6. Bf4 { Since White is delaying the development of their
kingside knight, we have to develop and attack White's queen with tempo.
Play Bg4 anyway. } 6... Bg4 $1 { If white decides to push f3, this is a bad
move since it weakens their king's diagonal, and could invite some harmful
attacking ideas from us. } { [%csl Be1,Bf2,Bg3,Bh4][%cal Rf2f3] } 7. Qb3 {
Instead, White develops their queen out and takes advantage that b7 is no
longer guarded. Find the best way to defend b7. } { [%cal Rb3b7] } 7... Qd7
$1 { This is the only good move! Black defends their pawn, stops any Bb5
absolute pins, and defends the d6 square, making Bd6 possible in the
future. } { [%cal Rd7b7] } 8. Nd2 { Your bishop looks like it's locked in.
How can you free up its diagonal? } { [%csl Bf8] } 8... e6 $1 { [%csl
Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5,Bb4,Ba3] } 9. Ngf3 { Challenge White's control over the h2
- b8 diagonal. } 9... Bd6 { [%csl Rb8,Rc7,Rd6,Re5,Rf4,Rg3,Rh2] } 10. Bxd6
Qxd6 11. O-O { White castles, seeing that if they take our b7 pawn, we have
Rb8 and will win their b2 pawn next. We will do the same and castle too,
getting our king to safety and connecting our rooks. } 11... O-O { Our main
game plan will be to launch a minority attack on the queenside by
controlling the semi-open c-file and expanding with a6-b5 to plant our
knight on the strong c4 outpost. Since White has a queenside majority, we
will use our queenside minority to break up White's queenside so that in
the endgame, White will have isolated or doubled pawns, where we will be
able to attack them easily. } { [%csl Rd4,Rb7,Ra7,Rc3,Rb2,Ra2][%cal
