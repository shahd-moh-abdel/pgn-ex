{ Excuse me for the position I have set up here. We will be looking at the
BARE-BONE BASICS of the minority attack. In the minority attack, your plan
revolves around attacking White's queenside pawn majority with your pawn
minority, hence the name: Minority Attack. Attack with a6! } { [%csl
Bb7,Ba7] }

1... a6 $1 { This move prepares the pawn push b5! } { [%cal Yb7b5] } 2. Kh1
{ I am just going to be shuffling the White king around. What move were we
preparing? } 2... b5 $1 3. Kg1 { Now, push again with your a-pawn! } 3...
a5 $1 { a5 prepares to push with b4! } { [%cal Rb5b4] } 4. Kh1 b4 5. cxb4 {
recapture } 5... axb4 6. a3 { Capture their pawn! } 6... bxa3 7. bxa3 { As
you can see, the White King has 2 isolated, weak pawns, while our pawn
structure is amazing! Usually, if you execute the minority attack
correctly, this is the position you will get. And in the endgame, you can
use your heavy pieces to target these weak pawns and hopefully be up 2
pawns in material. } { [%csl Bd4,Ba3] } *
