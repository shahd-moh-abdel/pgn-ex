{ This is a typical caro-kann position where your dark-squared bishop is
protecting your knight on f6 which is protecting the h7 square. In this
fashion, no one can checkmate you. To start the Minority attack, first play
Rc8 } { [%csl Yh7,Rf6][%cal Re7f6,Yf6h7,Ba8c8,Bc6a5,Ba5c4] }

2... Rc8 $1 { Rc8 is a very important move to start the minority attack
because you want to control the semi-open c-file with your rook. } { [%cal
Rc8c1] } 3. Kh1 { Now, prepare b5 with a6! } 3... a6 $1 { [%cal Gb7b5] } 4.
Kg1 { What move were we preparing? } 4... b5 $1 { Very good! Our rook on c8
and our d5-b5 pawns all work together to control the important c4 square. }
{ [%csl Rc4][%cal Rc8c4,Rd5c4,Rb5c4] } 5. Kh1 { The reason is that, in a
perfect world, you want to plant your knight on the super-strong c4
outpost! How do you get your knight to c4? } { [%csl Bc4][%cal Bc6a5,Ba5c4]
} 5... Na5 $1 6. Kg1 { whats next? } 6... Nc4 $1 { This is the main setup
you are looking for when executing the Minority attack! Next you will play
a5-b4, to pry apart white's queenside pawn majority. } { [%cal Ra6a5,Rb5b4]
} 7. Rab1 { what were we setting up? } 7... a5 $1 { [%cal Rb5b4] } 8. Kh1 {
and? } 8... b4 $1 9. cxb4 { Recapture with the pawn } 9... axb4 { This is
our main middlegame strategy. We launch our pawns forward to their death,
but in return, we get a superior pawn structure and weak pawns to target in
White's camp. You will see this idea of the Minority attack all throughout
the Take-Variation chapters. } { [%csl Bd4,Bb2,Ba2,Bb4][%cal
