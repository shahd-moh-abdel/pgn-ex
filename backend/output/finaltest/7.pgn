{ This is a very common type of pawn structure in the Caro-Kann
take-variation, known as the Carlsbad pawn structure. White has a queenside
pawn majority, and we, as black, don't. The fight is 2 pawns vs. 4 pawns.
Doesn't seem very fair. This is why we will deploy a ruthless queenside
strategy known as the MINORITY ATTACK!! } { [%csl
