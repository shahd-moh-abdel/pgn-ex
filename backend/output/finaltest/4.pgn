1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3. e5
{ next? } 3... c5 4. dxc5 { White decides to capture your pawn. What is the
best move for your queenside knight? } 4... Nc6 { If white is not careful,
we will capture their central pawn. } { [%csl Re5][%cal Rc6e5] } 5. Nf3 {
What move do you play when white's knight is developed? } 5... Bg4 $1 6.
Be2 { Our dark-squared bishop is looking rather sad. How can we cheer him
up? } 6... e6 $1 { Very good! Now that the diagonal is opened, we can
recapture the material. } { [%csl Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5] } 7. O-O { Regain
material } 7... Bxc5 8. Nc3 { According to the Lichess Database, Nc3 is the
most popular move. What is a sequence of moves that eliminates the e5 pawn?
} { [%csl Re5] } 8... Bxf3 $1 { Very good spotting that! We are removing
the defender of e5. } 9. Bxf3 Nxe5 { Now we can capture and we have a
dominating center. } 10. Bf4 { Trade the bishop pair. } 10... Nxf3+ 11.
Qxf3 { Develop your knight out to its best square. } 11... Nf6 { There is
no reason to go the long route of Ne7 and Nf5 because there are no central
pawns to target. Our gameplan is very simple. We will castle short, bring
our queen to c7 or b6 and control the c-file with our rooks. } { [%cal
