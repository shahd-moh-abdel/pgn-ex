1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3.
Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 5. Ng3 { White retreats back to g3. A very passive
play for white, but it is played very often, as it is the second most
common response to Nf6. We will respond with h5 because we want to attack
white's badly placed knight with h4, forcing it to move again. } 5... h5 $1
{ [%cal Rh5h4] } 6. h4 { Remember, if white allows us to play h4, then we
will. In this case, white stops us, and we will continue by attacking the
center with our c-pawn. } 6... c5 $1 { This also makes way for Nc6 ideas. }
{ [%cal Gc5d4,Rb8c6,Bd8d1] } 7. Nf3 { What developing move do you play when
you see white develop their knight out? } 7... Bg4 $1 { It's around equal
but I like how we're able to develop rapidly with threats. We will continue
with Nc6 and e6. } { [%csl Rd4][%cal Rg4d1,Ge7e6,Gb8c6] } *
