1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3. e5
{ In the first couple of chapters, we will look at what I call the push
variation. Attack the center by pushing your c-pawn. } 3... c5 $1 { Your
pawns want to break up the center like this in the Caro-Kann. } 4. c3 { 51%
of the time, White protects their pawns like this. What is a developing
move that adds more pressure on the d4 pawn? } 4... Nc6 { [%cal
Rc5d4,Rc6d4] } 5. Nf3 { White defends their pawn. Here we can simply
capture white's d4 pawn with our c5 pawn. } 5... cxd4 { Btw, if the knight
were to recapture, the e5 pawn would no longer be protected and we can
simply win a pawn. } { [%cal Gf3d4,Gc6e5] } 6. cxd4 { The reason why we
capture immediately is because we want white to have an isolated pawn. We
can then use that weak pawn as an advantage for us, as our gameplan will
mostly be to target that pawn and try to win it to have a material
advantage in the endgame. Now, develop your light-squared bishop to the
best square. } { [%csl Rd4,Bc8] } 6... Bg4 $1 { Correct! Whenever White
develops their knight out, we want to pin it with our bishop. } 7. Be2 {
Your dark-squared bishop looks a little sad. What move opens up the
diagonal for your dark-squared bishop? } 7... e6 $1 { [%csl
Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5,Bb4,Ba3] } 8. O-O { Develop your kingside knight. } { [%csl
Bg8] } 8... Nge7 { Our idea is to place our knight on f5, where it exerts
more pressure on white's isolated d4 pawn } { [%cal Be7f5,Rf5d4,Rc6d4] } 9.
Nc3 { What were we preparing? } 9... Nf5 $1 { [%cal Rf5d4,Rc6d4] } 10. Be3
{ Develop your dark-squared bishop to the best square. } 10... Be7 11. h3 {
If White attacks your light-squared bishop, you can trade white's knight
because it eliminates a key defender of white's already weak, isolated
pawn. } 11... Bxf3 12. Bxf3 { What bishop move can get rid of White's
dark-squared bishop? } 12... Bg5 $1 { Correct! } 13. Qd3 { After white
plays, lets say Qd3, we will simply castle since there is no rush in
trading bishops. } 13... O-O { Now that our king is safely castled, we can
trade bishops on the next move if possible. Our game plan is very simple:
firstly, we will (obviously) trade bishops and then create a minority
attack on the queenside with a6-b5, follow it up with Rc8, and try to
undermine the e5 pawn with f6. } { [%cal Gg5e3,Ga7a6,Gb7b5,Ga8c8,Gf7f6] } *
