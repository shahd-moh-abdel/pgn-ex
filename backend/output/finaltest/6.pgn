1. e4 { What are your opening moves? } 1... c6 2. d4 { and? } 2... d5 3. e5
{ next? } 3... c5 4. Nf3 { White develops his knight out and protects d4.
Instead of playing Bg4 immediately, we will calmly capture white's d4 pawn.
} 4... cxd4 5. Nxd4 { Now, we can develop our queenside knight, which
attacks the white centralized knight and their undefended e5 pawn. } 5...
Nc6 $1 { [%cal Gc6e5,Gc6d4] } 6. Bb5 { White decides to pin the knight to
the king; what is the best way to unpin our knight? } { [%cal Rb5c6,Rc6e8]
} 6... Bd7 $1 7. Bxc6 { What is the best way to recapture it? } 7... bxc6 {
We recapture with the pawn instead of the bishop because we want to keep
the bishop pair and create a strong pawn center. } 8. O-O { open your
dark-squared bishop's diagonal } { [%csl Bf8] } 8... e6 { [%csl
Bf8,Be7,Bd6,Bc5,Bb4,Ba3] } 9. Nc3 { Attack the center with a flank pawn! }
9... c5 { [%cal Rc5d4] } 10. Nf3 { Develop your kingside knight to its best
square } { [%csl Bg8] } 10... Ne7 $1 { We are going for the same idea and
want to plant our knight on f5. } { [%cal Ge7f5,Gg8e7] } 11. Bg5 { kick
away the bishop } 11... h6 $1 { [%cal Rh6g5] } 12. Bh4 { attack the bishop
once more } 12... g5 $1 { [%cal Rg5h4] } 13. Bg3 { Attack the bishop again
with your knight! } 13... Nf5 $17 { This is the most common line when White
protects their pawn with the knight. We are already much better with a -1.8
advantage. We can continue the game with Bc6, placing the bishop on a
stronger diagonal, Qb6, attacking white's weak b2 pawn, and follow up with
c4, which gains space on the Queenside. } { [%cal Gd7c6,Gd8b6,Gc5c4] } *
